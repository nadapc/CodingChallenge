Mobile Coding Challenge 

Hello There, 
here is the details about the Project:

1// to test the project you just need to run it, and it will send the first request to the server automatically to get the data.

2// when you scroll the list view ,in the end of scroll , another request is sent to get the data of the next page.

3// if you click on the back button of your phone, the method onKeyDown () is executed and the database is deleted. 

4// for the image loader I used the Picasso library. 

5// the data is saved in the SQLite database.

6// the data is displayed in listview .
